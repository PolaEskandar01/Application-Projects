Project Name: YardAtYourHouse

YardAtYourHouse is a program designed to help clients purchase landscapes for their yards. It provides clients with a choice between a grass or gravel yard and displays
the price per square foot for each type.
Once the client selects their desired option, they can enter their name, address, and yard dimensions, and receive a summary of their order.
Clients can then submit their order or exit the program using the file tab.
The program also includes a customer list tab, which allows users to load or delete existing customer information.
